  # Welcome to Elixir Bridge.

  Hello, Its great to have you here ! Do you like traveling ? We hope so,
  because in Elixir Bridge you'll be freelancing around the world visiting
  our favorite clients. We though that you would come here in order to learn
  how to solve problems and build software with Elixir. Since we know that
  your time is valuable, we decided that a great way to achieve this goal
  is by doing some actual work. Don't worry, you'll be among great engineers
  that will help you.

  You arrived to the departing airport in which you'll start
  your trip. Get ready !

  We've designed a guide which traces the route for your journey.
  It contains information about the clients
  you'll be working with and the connecting flights you have to catch in other
  parts of the world.
  Don't worry if you miss a flight, we can always rearrange schedules. Believe
  it or not, airlines around here are pretty good. You'll be surprised.

  Here are suggestions for your safe and successful travels.

  - Remember that you are an engineer and you are here to create solutions.
  - Keep in mind that engineers are professionals.
  - As a professional, is your responsibility to ask if you don't understand or know something.

  If you get lost, remember you can contact a 24/7 community that is spread
  around the world. They're great people and love to help. The ways
  you can contact them are listed below:
  1. [Slack](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com). Just access and choose your username.
