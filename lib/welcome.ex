  # Welcome to ElixirBridge.

  Hello, it's great to have you here! We hope you like to travel because
  in ElixirBridge you'll be flying around the world visiting people that
  are looking for great students like you. They're looking out for somebody
  that can solve problems and use Elixir to write solutions. We think you're
  the best candidate because we know you're eager to learn.

  You will be traveling with a team, so don't worry! You'll be able to work
  with teachers that will guide your development. In
  addition to your team, we've designed a travel guide in which you can find
  useful information such as where to go next and who's the person you'll be
  working with. It also includes flight schedules for the different cities
  around the world.

  A cab will pick you up in 5 minutes and will take you to the airport to jump
  on your first adventure. Let us know when you get there by clicking
  [here](Introduction.html).


  Hello, it's great to have you here ! We're really exited you decided to learn
  Elixir.
