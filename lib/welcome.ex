  # Welcome to Elixir Bridge.

  Hello, Its great to have you here ! We hope you like to travel because
  in Elixir Bridge you'll be flying around the world visiting people that
  are looking for software engineers like you. They're looking out for somebody
  that can solve problems and use Elixir to write the solution. We think you're
  the best candidate because you're eager to learn.

  You will be traveling with a team, so don't worry ! You'll be able to work
  with more experienced engineers that will guide your development. In
  addition to your team, we've designed a travel guide where you can find
  useful information such as where to go next to who to talk to. It also
  includes flight schedules for the different cities around the world and
  guess what ? We got it covered ;)

  A cab will pick you up in 5 minutes and will take you to the airport.

  Let us know when you get there by clicking [here](Introduction.html).
