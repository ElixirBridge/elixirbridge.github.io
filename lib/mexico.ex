  Fly to Cancun. Work with a tourism business and find out the right number
  per year of tourists they need. They have a semi working system you have
  to tweak. There seem to be a problem with counter of tourists.

      # The excercise will have a Module with the "legacy" code from the
      # problem loaded in the env. The problem requires you to figure out what's the bug. Few
      # adjustemnts in the source code should take place. Finish by having the user create
      # his first function.
