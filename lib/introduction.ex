  # Welcome to the Airport

  You made it! Let's go through some information before you get on the plane.

  On each destination you'll receive information of your next trip.

  Here are suggestions for your safe and successful travels.

  - Remember that you are a great student and you are here to create solutions.
  - We encourage you to ask if you don't understand or know something.

  If you get lost, don't hesitate to ask the teacher or your teammates. And remember
  you can contact a 24/7 community that is spread
  around the world. They're great people and love to help. The channels
  you can use:
